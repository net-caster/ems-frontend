# EMS frontend files

### React components for the EMS project hosted on Netlify

In this app the user can sign up as an employer and manage their employees.

They can add new employees, edit their information or delete them.

They can assign shifts for their employees and also edit or delete existing
shifts.

The total hours and gross wages are calculated for each week and can be
viewed in the **Schedule** tab.

* The front-end was built with **_React_** **_Hooks_** and packaged with **_WebPack_** for
optimization and backwards compatibility.

* The back-end was built on **_Node.JS_** with **_Express.JS_** for routing and **_JSON_**
**_Web_** **_Token_** for authorization and authentication.

* The app uses **_MySQL_** for data storage with the **_Sequelize_** ORM.

* The front-end, back-end and database were split into three and hosted
on different servers with exclusive access to each other.

**The back-end is hosted on Heroku so please wait a few seconds for the dyno
to restart. Thank you.*
